# Spatial Inventory System for Unreal Engine

## Project Overview
A comprehensive spatial inventory system blueprint for Unreal Engine featuring:
- Equipment slots (helmet, armor, weapons, etc.)
- Clothing slots with customizable inventory space
- Backpack and vest systems
- Dynamic slot management
- Spatial grid-based inventory UI

## Project Architecture
- **Core Systems**: Blueprint-based inventory management
