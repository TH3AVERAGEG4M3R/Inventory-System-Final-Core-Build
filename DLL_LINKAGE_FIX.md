âœ… DLL LINKAGE ISSUES RESOLVED

Fixed all 'inconsistent dll linkage' compilation errors:

CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:
1. Static Member Export: Added INVENTORYSYSTEM_API to ABP_InventoryManager::ManagerInstance
2. Private Function Declarations: Added UFUNCTION() to all private helper functions  
3. API Macro Consistency: Ensured all classes have proper INVENTORYSYSTEM_API declarations

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Static data members must be explicitly exported with INVENTORYSYSTEM_API
- Private functions referenced by UHT need UFUNCTION() declarations  
- All public class functions require consistent API linkage

RESULT: Clean compilation with proper module export/import handling
STATUS: All DLL linkage errors eliminated, ready for production build
