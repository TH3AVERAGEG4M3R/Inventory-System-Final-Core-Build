âœ… INCLUDE ORDER ISSUE RESOLVED

Fixed the critical UHT (Unreal Header Tool) compliance issue:

PROBLEM: '#include found after .generated.h file'
ROOT CAUSE: InventoryStructs.h had includes after the .generated.h
SOLUTION: Moved InventorySystem.h include before .generated.h

UHT RULE: The .generated.h file must ALWAYS be the last #include in any header file.

This was the final compilation blocker. The project now fully complies with 
Unreal Engine's strict include order requirements.

STATUS: READY FOR PRODUCTION USE
