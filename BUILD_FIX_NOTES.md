# URGENT FIX NEEDED

The compilation is failing despite correct syntax. The issue is likely one of:

1. **Cached .generated.h files** with old GENERATED_BODY(); syntax
2. **Engine version compatibility** with IncludeOrderVersion
3. **Module dependency ordering** issues

## Actions taken:
- Updated IncludeOrderVersion to Latest (safest option)
- Simplified module dependencies 
- Removed potentially problematic InputCore from public dependencies

## Next steps needed:
1. Delete ALL generated files (Binaries/, Intermediate/, .vs/, *.sln, *.vcxproj*)
2. Run GenerateProjectFiles.bat to regenerate everything fresh
3. Build clean in Visual Studio

The 'Extra ; before public' errors suggest the UHT (Unreal Header Tool) is generating headers with old syntax from cached data.
