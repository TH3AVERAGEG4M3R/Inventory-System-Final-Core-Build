# COMPLETE PROJECT REBUILD APPROACH

## Root Cause Analysis
The persistent DLL linkage errors indicate that the project has fundamental module configuration issues that cannot be fixed by incremental changes. The entire module architecture needs to be rebuilt with proper UE5 standards.

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Module Type**: Runtime module needs explicit declaration
2. **API Macro Consistency**: INVENTORYSYSTEM_API must be applied correctly throughout
3. **Build Configuration**: PCHUsage and dependency declarations need UE5.5 standards
4. **Static Member Handling**: Static members in DLL interface classes require special handling

## Rebuild Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Fix Build.cs with proper module configuration
2. **Phase 2**: Ensure all UCLASS/USTRUCT have consistent API declarations  
3. **Phase 3**: Remove problematic static singleton pattern
4. **Phase 4**: Validate all include dependencies

## Expected Result
After rebuild: Zero DLL linkage errors, clean compilation in UE 5.5.4

This approach addresses the fundamental architectural issues rather than attempting incremental fixes on a broken foundation.
